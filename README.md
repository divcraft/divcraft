## Welcome
I am Tomasz Ogonowski and this is my github profile.

I specialise in projecting and developing websites and web applications.  

## My main projects I'd like you to see

The project has been based on MongoDB, Express, React & Node.js technologies.

The most complex and most important project I have made. It contains the biggest amount of technologies I'm familiar with. If you want to know precisely what I do, you should start reviewing me with this one. I hope you will like it.


### divcraft

### Calculator

- https://github.com/divcraft/calculator

A standard-mode calculator based on Windows10 system calculator. The whole project has been created without using third-party libraries. Simple structure of code allows you to focus more on its logic. Enjoy.


### Business card pages
